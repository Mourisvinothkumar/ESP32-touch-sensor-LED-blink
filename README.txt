# Blink an External LED Using Touch Sensor on ESP32

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP32's touch sensor to control an external LED. When the touch sensor is activated, the LED toggles its state (ON/OFF).

---

## Features
- Utilize the ESP32's built-in capacitive touch sensor.
- Control an external LED based on touch input.
- Simple and efficient code, easy to adapt for other applications.

---

## Hardware Requirements
1. **ESP32 Development Board (e.g., ESP32-WROOM)**
2. **External LED**
3. **Resistor (220Î©)**
4. **Connecting Wires**
5. **Breadboard**

## Wiring Diagram
| Component      | ESP32 Pin |
|----------------|-----------|
| LED (Anode)    | GPIO16    |
| LED (Cathode)  | GND       |
| Touch Sensor   | T0 (GPIO4)|

### Connection Notes
- Connect a 220Î© resistor in series with the LED to prevent damage.
- The touch sensor pin used in this project is `T0`, which corresponds to `GPIO4`.

---

## Software Requirements
1. **Arduino IDE**
   - Install [ESP32 board support](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32).
2. **Libraries**
   - No additional libraries required (touch sensors are built into the ESP32).

---

## How It Works
1. The touch sensor (T0) detects a touch.
2. When touched, the LED toggles its state:
   - If the LED is OFF, it turns ON.
   - If the LED is ON, it turns OFF.

## Code
Hereâ€™s the Arduino code for this project:
---
int ledPin = 16;
void setup(){

  Serial.begin(115200);
  pinMode(ledPin,OUTPUT);
}
void loop(){
  
  if(touchRead(T0)< 20){
     digitalWrite(ledPin,HIGH); 
  }else{
    digitalWrite(ledPin,LOW); 
  }
  delay(200);
}


## Steps to Run
1. **Set Up Hardware:**
   - Connect the components according to the wiring diagram.

2. **Upload Code:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Paste the code into the IDE.
   - Select your ESP32 board under **Tools > Board**.
   - Select the correct port under **Tools > Port**.
   - Upload the code.

3. **Test:**
   - Touch the designated touch pin (T0/ GPIO4).
   - Observe the LED toggling between ON and OFF states.

## Notes
- Adjust the touch threshold (`30` in the code) based on your setup and environment.
- Use `Serial Monitor` at a baud rate of `115200` to observe touch values for calibration.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for multiple touch pins.
- Implement touch hold functionality for dimming or PWM control of the LED.
- Replace the LED with other actuators for more complex applications.
